### 17 Jun Update
- LOL I spied on a friend who was using Haml and decided to check it out keke, trendfollower. It was easy to set up.
- `gem install haml`
- Create a haml file using the new syntax, then on command line, `haml test.haml test.haml`
- If you're using Sublime Text, you can automate this by building it. See this cool thing [here!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27154136/build-haml-automatic-in-sublime-3-doesnt-work)
- Basically, download SublimeOnSaveBuild package, edit the Settings-user and add a `haml.sublime-build` file under the Sublime Package
- Yay happy kid now no need to worry how to close my divs
